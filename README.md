## Abstract
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures and lockdowns have been adopted as a cornerstone to limit the spread of the disease. Yet, the effectiveness of stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions depend on people’s levels of adherence. In this paper, we apply social-psychological research to the study of compliance with stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. Chile is a particularly interesting case because lockdown implementations have shown lower effectiveness in reducing mobility than in other countries. We consider three possible models underlying lockdown adherence: a) sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, b) instrumental factors and c) normative factors. We draw on data from a cross-sectional representative sample (Study 1, n = 1,078) and a longitudinal non-representative panel study (Study 2, n = 32,304) to explore the impact of these different factors on lockdown compliance. Findings show the strongest support for the role of a normative model, in that people who adhere to lockdown report to a greater extent than relatives and friends stay at home too. Findings on the role of risk perceptions are mixed. We finish by proposing policy recommendations to generate effective strategies to contain the spread of the virus.
